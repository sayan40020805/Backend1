# Quick Polls App - Deployment Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed:
1. **Fixed hardcoded localhost URLs** in share URL generation
2. **Improved Socket.io CORS configuration** for production security
3. **Added environment variables** for production deployment
4. **Updated both main server and mock server files**

## 📁 Files Modified:
- ✅ `routes/polls.js` - Fixed hardcoded frontend URL with environment variable support
- ✅ `updated-server.js` - Fixed hardcoded backend URL with environment variable support
- ✅ `src/server.js` - Improved Socket.io CORS configuration for security
- ✅ `.env.example` - Added comprehensive environment variables

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. **Create .env file** from .env.example for your deployment
2. **Update environment variables** with your actual domain URLs
3. **Test locally** with environment variables
4. **Deploy and verify** share URLs work correctly

## 🔧 Environment Variables to Set:

For production deployment, create a `.env` file with:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
PRODUCTION_FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## 🔒 Security Improvements:

- **Socket.io CORS**: Now properly validates origins instead of allowing all (`*`)
- **Environment-based URLs**: Share URLs automatically use correct domain based on environment
- **Production-ready**: Supports both development and production configurations

## 🧪 Testing:

1. **Local Testing**: Set `NODE_ENV=development` and use localhost URLs
2. **Production Testing**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` and use your deployed URLs
3. **Share Links**: Test that poll share URLs work correctly in both environments

## 📝 Usage:

After setting up your environment variables:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

The app will automatically use the correct URLs for share links and Socket.io connections based on your environment configuration.
